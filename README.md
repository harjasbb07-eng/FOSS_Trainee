I be **Harjas**, a humble scholar devoted to the sacred arts of code and creation. Born upon the **twenty-seventh day of August**, in the **year of our Lord two thousand and seven**, I hail from the venerable realm of **Patiala**, nestled in the province of **Punjab**.  

Mine scholarly sigil, **IIB2025014**, doth mark my place within the grand order of learners. Under the watchful guidance of the wise and noble **Sir Manas Singh**, I wander the path of wisdom with diligence, patience, and a pinch of jest. 🎓  

In my early years, I didst hone my wits within the hallowed halls of **St. Peter’s Academy**, and thereafter at **The Millennium School**, both sanctified by the sacred scrolls of **CBSE**. With relentless toil, I emerged bearing marks of **98.4** and **97.4**, trophies of diligence most fair.  

My trials of **JEE** were undertaken beneath the banner of **Vedantu Offline**, where light of screen and shadow of doubt wrestled nightly. I triumphed with a **Mains rank near 2750**, and an **Advanced rank near 9320**, both victories forged through resolve and sleepless vigils. 🏆

## 🎮 *Of Hobbies and Odd Delights*  

In the quiet hours, I doth find pleasure in the realms of **gaming** and the culinary crafts of mortal delight 🍳. Oft do I venture through enchanted worlds of **Pokémon**, ensnaring creatures of mystery and might 🐉.  

A collector of **ancient coins** am I, treasuring each as a relic of forgotten kings and kingdoms. 💰  

Once, upon the court of **basketball**, fate struck with curious humor — mine arm was cleft, and the bone did pierce forth as though to greet the heavens! Yet I laughed, for the limb did dangle as though woven of rubber. Truly, the jest of life spareth none. 😅

## 🏫 *Of Collegiate Wanderings*  

Thus far, mine sojourn through the hallowed corridors of college hath yielded no tale of great mischief nor adventure — alas, the bards shall find little song in my current days. Mayhaps destiny keepeth her finest tales for the morrow.

## ⚡ *Guilds and Aspirations*  

I seeketh to join the guilds of **Virtuosi** and **GeekHaven** — sanctuaries of intellect and invention, where the flame of curiosity burneth ever bright. 🔮💻
